Make it super easy to create a new bounty and pay for it. Try to replace bounstr.org, and migrate all bounties to the app, so that they are in a centralized place (even though we love decentralization).

Use nostr web browser login for authentication, create an event for bounty / adding pledges, DM user when the task is completed, or applied for by a person, be able to edit it before it's accepted, be able to accept it, be able to comment on it even after it's accepted, and make payment just a zap. Also be able to reference people who may want to accept it in the original note and DM those people (right now I had to notify people by hand, even though I know who would be interested in applying for the bounty).

Also probably it's wise to talk to the client authors to make sure that it goes through the DM spam filter.

@diamsa (Diego) works on https://nostrbounties.com/ , but didn't notify me yet that he wants to work on this bounty
