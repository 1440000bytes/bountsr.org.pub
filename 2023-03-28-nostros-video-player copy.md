In Nostros we are committed to create a truly FOSS and de-googled nostr app. One the most challenging goals is to always find the right libraries and tools in sync with this philosophy.

One of the libraries we are still looking for is a video player. The most promising library is https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vlc-media-player
