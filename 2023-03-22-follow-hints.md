If an event references another using a tag with a relay hint, make sure you try to fetch the event from the hinted relay -- in addition to other relays you may decide to use. Also follow the relay and author hints in `nevent` URLs, the relay hints in `nprofile` URLs and the relay hints in NIP-05 metadata.

I may have forgotten some, but this bounty applies to all major open-source clients in operation:

 - Nozzle
 - Nostros
 - Iris
 - Coracle
 - Snort
 - Gossip
 - Nuestr
 - Astral
 - Amethyst
 - Plasma
 - Satellite (when open-source)
 - Camelus

For other clients please ask first, or suggest adding here with a PR.

The bounty can be increased depending on the implementation.

The bounty doesn't have to be claimed by the app maintainer, it can be claimed by whoever implemented the feature.

Multiple payouts of this same bounty can be made if it is implemented in multiple apps.
