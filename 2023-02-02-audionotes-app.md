An iOS or Android app that just sends audio notes, like Telegram/WhatsApp have, but broadcasting them as `kind:1` events. The audio contents should not be in the Nostr events, they should be just a URL.

Add a special tag to these events to identify them as pure audio (probably `t: audio`) and only fetch other pure-audio notes like that and render that in a way that is simple to listen.

If you don't want to use Telegram, mention me on Nostr (`npub180cvv07tjdrrgpa0j7j7tmnyl2yr6yr7l8j4s3evf6u64th6gkwsyjh6w6`/`nprofile1qqsrhuxx8l9ex335q7he0f09aej04zpazpl0ne2cgukyawd24mayt8gpr4mhxue69uhkummnw3ez6ur4vgh8wetvd3hhyer9wghxuet5qyw8wumn8ghj7mn0wd68yttjv4kxz7fww4h8get5dpezumt9qy38wumn8ghj7mn0wd68yttkv4exjenfv4jzuam9d3kx7unyv4ezumn9wslzm9ln`) and we can chat in public (I don't use Nostr DMs currently).
