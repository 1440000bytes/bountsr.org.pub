The idea is to implement the group chat NIP (and possibly improve upon it) in a native (for iOS, Android or Desktop) client that puts relays at the forefront.

For example, instead of just "join group x" the user must be able to say "join group X on relays A, B and C -- simultaneously join group Y on relays B, D and E" and change that overtime. Groups must be shared using `nevent` type indicating the relays they're being hosted in by default (although nothing prevents them from existing in multiple places or even in parallel universes accessible only on mysteryous relays).

A client should also try to rebroadcast messages it gets from one relay in that group to the other relays it is using that group for.

This is just a basic concept of what I want to see done. I'm open to ideas. Please talk before building. See also https://t.me/nostrdesign/1367 for some rogue ideas related to making relays first-class citizens.
