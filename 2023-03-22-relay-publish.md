Make it easy for users to select to which relays they will publish each note when writing them. Or after writing and publishing to some relays, let them republish the same note to new relays.

What I have in mind is a list of checkboxes with the relays preconfigured as per NIP-65 "write" rules, with all preselected, and then the user can toggle -- but I am sure you'll think of something better.

I may have forgotten some, but this bounty applies to all major open-source clients in operation:

 - Nozzle
 - Nostros
 - Iris
 - Coracle
 - Snort
 - Gossip
 - Nuestr
 - Astral
 - Amethyst
 - Plasma
 - Satellite (when open-source)
 - Camelus

For other clients please ask first, or suggest adding here with a PR.

The bounty can be increased depending on the implementation.

The bounty doesn't have to be claimed by the app maintainer, it can be claimed by whoever implemented the feature.

Multiple payouts of this same bounty can be made if it is implemented in multiple apps.
