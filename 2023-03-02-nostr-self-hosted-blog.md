Build a Ghost-blog like self-hosted replacement on Nostr.

- Similar to Habla.news. 
- Some easy way to self host it (ie GitHub Pages) and brand it. 
- Display only your selected pubkeys and/or specific notes.
- Using Kind 23.

This would help authors and companies move their blogs to Nostr and still serve on the web.
