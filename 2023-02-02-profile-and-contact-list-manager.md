Micro web-app for managing metadata, contact lists, relay lists.
Simple and fast. With NIP-07 and `nprofile` support.
Must store data locally such that if someone uses some other app and the other app replaces the data they can recover by going to this app.
May be an extension or contribution to https://github.com/talvasconcelos/metanostr / https://metadata.nostr.com.
