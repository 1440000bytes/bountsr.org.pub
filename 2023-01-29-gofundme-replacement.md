Build an mvp solution for Social-Fund-Raising with Bitcoin on Nostr, Ideally a 1 to 1 alternative to the centralized GoFundMe.

- This MVP could be simple as fund raising Campaign by posting a note with reply notes.
- The original "Campaign" needs proper [long form styling, that could be tackled with this other bounty](https://bountsr.org/code/2023/01/25/medium-replacement.html)
- Clever discoverability of causes and supporters
- Aside from a simple bitcoin address, good Lightning integration with funding "splits" and other multisig for onchain would help with funds management.
