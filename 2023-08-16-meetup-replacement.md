Meetup is a centralized and crappy platform. Sure it has market share, but there should be something for the hardcore bitcoiners to create events on and RSVP to.  There is NIP52, but that seems to be more virtual focused. This could just be a NIP, a new app, or a feature added to existsing apps. As a meetup host, all I want is a way to create an event and track RSVPs. I personally use Amethyst so I'd prefer it there, but I think _any_ 2 nostr apps would suffice.
