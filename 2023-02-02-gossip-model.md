Video explanation of the Gossip model: https://mikedilger.com/gossip-relay-model.mp4
Gossip codebase: https://github.com/mikedilger/gossip

The idea is to implement this model (or a variant of it) for keeping track of relays people post in and following them and making Nostr more decentralized in one of the already established clients:

 - Amethyst
 - Nozzle
 - Nostros
 - Astral
 - Hamstr
 - Snort
 - Iris
 - Coracle
 - Plasma

For other clients please ask first.

Basic description of the essence of the Gossip model:

  - Keep track of relays in which people post on, according to:
    - events from that person seen on that relay
    - relay hints from other events
    - `nprofile` relays
    - NIP-05 relays
    - kind 2
    - kind 3
    - etc
  - Discover new relays organically through route hints while browsing global feeds, loading replies (from whatever relays) and following relay hints in events
  - When loading the home feed, try to not connect to all relays on the earth, and only ask the relevant relays for the relevant pubkeys instead of flooding queries.
  - Make relays manually editable for each person followed

The bounty can be increased depending on the implementation.

Multiple payouts of this same bounty can be made if it is implemented in multiple apps.

If you want to add more apps to the list above please open a PR in this repo and tag me.
